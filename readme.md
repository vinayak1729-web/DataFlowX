Enhanced Data Science Platform
A Streamlit-based web application for end-to-end data science workflows, including data collection, cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, optimization, deployment, and monitoring.
Features

Interactive Dashboard: Visualize data and model performance.
Data Processing: Handle missing values, duplicates, outliers, and data types.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Generate statistical summaries and visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices).
Feature Engineering: Scale features, encode categorical variables, and create new features.
Model Training: Support for classification and regression with multiple algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
Model Evaluation: Metrics, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and learning curves.
Model Optimization: Hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and ensemble methods.
Deployment: Export models and simulate API deployment.
Monitoring: Detect data drift and generate PDF reports.
